Threebody on matplotlib<br />

Tried to make a simple threebody system on matplotlib. It is working but not work very perfect.<br />


![image tooltip here](https://github.com/boweiww/learn/blob/master/python/Figure_1.png)

I there are several reason that causing this case:<br />
1.The initial position of the threebody is random. That will cause the force and speed of each element is random.<br />
2.The refresh rate of the anime api of matplotlib is not high enough.<br />

Since I dont understand threebody system very well, there can be something wrong. I will be very happy if anyone can inform the problem. : )<br />
